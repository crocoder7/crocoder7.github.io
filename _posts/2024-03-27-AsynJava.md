# Async programming in JAVA with CompletableFuture.

CompletableFuture was introduced to support asynchronous programming since Java 8. <br/>
The async annotation(@Async) can be another option for asynchronous calls when using the Spring framework, but CompletableFuture is applicable to any framework as long as Java is being used. <br/>
Executor should be configured to use async annotation. <br/><br/>

However, executor does not need to be configured to use CompletableFuture. <br/>
Fork/Join pool is used as default thread pool if executor is not used. <br/>
The default pool size is, **(Available processors) * 2 - 1**
The code would be like below.

```
public CompletableFuture<ResponseEntity<String>> someAsyncMethod() {
  return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> someService.someServiceMethod())
          .thenApply(response -> ResponseEntity.ok(response));
}
```

You can use the configured executor in the method if you prefer to use a fixed thread pool instead of the Fork/Join pool.

```
private final Executor executor;

public CompletableFuture<ResponseEntity<String>> someAsyncMethod() {
  return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> someService.someServiceMethod(), executor)
          .thenApply(response -> ResponseEntity.ok(response));
}
```

Please ensure that you return a CompletableFuture instead of the response after calling the get method on it. <br/>
Doing so would result in blocking the CompletableFuture, rendering it useless for asynchronous calls. <br/><br/>

The choice of pool type should be based on the type of job it performs. <br/>
The Fork/Join pool utilizes a divide-and-conquer algorithm to break down jobs into smaller pieces and execute them concurrently. <br/>
In my test case, the API was uploading file to S3 bucket, logic to check for identical file names was also added. <br/>

First row is synchronous call, without using any thread pool. <br/>
Second row is using Fork/Join pool with a size of 15. <br/>
Third row is using fixed thread pool with a size of 20. <br/><br/>

The result shows that first and third case is unstable while second case, using Fork/Join pool, is stable. <br/>
It demonstrates that the algorithm of the Fork/Join pool can introduce additional overhead for relatively smaller jobs, resulting in lower TPS. <br/>
The sychronous call has a high TPS since it can utilize the entire resource of the machine, unrestricted by pool size, but they are very unstable due to blocking call. <br/><br/>

If a fixed-size thread pool is being used, what should be the optimal size for the pool? <br/>
Does increasing the pool size result in better performance? <br/>

![poolSizeCompare](/assets/images/poolSizeCompare.png)

The last row is using Fork/Join pool with a size of 15. <br/>
Fixed pool size of 10 has higher TPS than Fork/Join pool with a size of 15. <br/>
It's as I mentioned earlier, particularly for relatively smaller jobs. <br/><br/>

The highest TPS result is achieved with a pool size of 20, not with pool sizes of 30 or 40. <br/>
This indicates that the thread pool has a certain threshold that yields the best outcome. <br/>
Since the resources of the machine are limited, there comes a point where the overhead outweighs performance. <br/><br/>

Although we may believe we've found the optimal size through testing, real-life results can differ, as this API is not the only one used in the system. <br/>
However, load tests can serve as a useful reference.
